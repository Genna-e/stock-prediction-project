# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project leverages deep learning (LSTM) to predict stock prices based on historical data. By using Python, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib, the project provides insights into market trends and evaluates predictive accuracy using RMSE.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict stock prices.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes real vs. predicted stock prices for better understanding.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for data processing and modeling.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework for building and training the LSTM model.
- **yFinance**: Fetches historical stock price data.
- **Matplotlib**: Generates visualizations of the model's predictions.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for scaling and preprocessing data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Genna-e/stock-prediction-project.git

  2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd stock-prediction-project

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the Python script to train the model and generate predictions:
python stock_prediction.py

## Results
After running the script, a graph comparing real and predicted stock prices will be generated and saved as stock_prediction_graph.png.

# Future Improvements
Add multi-step forecasting to predict stock prices for several days ahead.
Include more features like trading volume, technical indicators, and news sentiment analysis.
Compare LSTM with other models like GRU and ARIMA for performance benchmarking.
